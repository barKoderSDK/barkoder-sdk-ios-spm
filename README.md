## Documentation
You can check out the barKoder SDK documentation right here:
**[barKoder Documentation](https://barkoder.com/docs/v1/ios/ios-sdk-installation)**

## Getting Started with Licensing
**[barKoder SDK](https://barkoder.com)** uses a license to operate.
Running the barKoder Barcode Scanner SDK without a valid trial or production license will still produce a result but the result will be prefixed with an Unlicensed string. Don't worry, though! You can easily get a trial license by registering on the barKoder Portal and using the self-service **[Evaluation License Generation](https://barkoder.com/request-quote)**
